# HTD Reader

This script opens htd files from high-throughput screens acquired in MetaXpress inside of FIJI 
by allowing one to select a well and site location instead of a series no.

## How to install:
Copy the HTD_Reader.py into FIJI's directory inside the Scripts folders.
After you start FIJI, you will be able to open the script via Tools > Script. 

## How to use:
Select the HTD file inside of the plate directory (not inside the timepoins' folders).
Select the well coordinate, the site no and press "Open Image".
The image will then open with the proper format.

## Future plans:
- Support for z-stacks
- Support for time-series.
